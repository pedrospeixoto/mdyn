\usage{
plotRisk_cases(
  states = "all",
  day = "today",
  day.init = NULL,
  day.final = NULL,
  cities = "populated",
  pos_name = "pop"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{states}{A vector with the states to build plots for. It should contain the two letters representing the name of the states. To plot all
available states enter "all", which is default.}

\item{day}{The date which to plot data from. The default is today. Must be represented as YYYY-MM-DD.}

\item{day.init}{To build a sequence of plots to an interval of days. Should represent the initial day of the range. This surpasses the
\emph{day} argument.}

\item{day.final}{The final day of the range.}

\item{cities}{Which cities to plot information for. It should either be "populated" for cities with the greatest populations or
a named list with the city names. The names must be the two letters representing the states. The city names must be written as they are in the
\emph{risk} dataset.}

\item{pos_name}{A string to put at the end of the saved plots. If you want to run with distinct cities for a same day, use this string
to not overwrite the plots.}
}
\value{
A list with all the generated plots, which were also saved on pdf files in high resolution

\description{
Build various plots combining the number of infected by COVID-19 in a city of a state in Brazil and the risk of infection
estimated by Peixoto et. al. (2020).
}
\details{
This function download data from <https://brasil.io/dataset/covid19/caso? about the number of confirmed infected individuals,
and confirmed deaths, by COVID-19 in each city of Brazil and build plots comparing these quantities with the risk of infection of each city
estimated by Peixoto et. al. (2020). It may consider data for a given day or a range of days during the pandemic.
